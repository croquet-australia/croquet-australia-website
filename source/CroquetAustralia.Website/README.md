# CroquetAustralia.Website

This project does **not** follow the conventional ASP.NET MVC structure. The structure is:

- `\App\` Client & server side controllers, views, scripts, view models, etc. See below for more details.
- `\App_Start\` Standard ASP.NET MVC configuration classes called during application start-up.
- Standard ASP.NET MVC files.

## \App directory

The \App directory is the break from convention. TODO - explain.
